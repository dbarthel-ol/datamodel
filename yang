--- abstract
This document describes a YANG model for Static Context Header Compression. 
A generic module is defined, that can be applied for any headers. 
A specific model for the IPv6 UDP protocol stack is also proposed. 
Note that this draft is a first attempt to define a YANG module for SCHC, 
more work is needed to use all the YANG facilities.

# Introduction {#Introduction}
<xref target="I-D.toutain-lpwan-ipv6-static-context-hc"/> defines a compression technique for LPWA network based on static 
context. The context contains a list of rules (cf. <xref target="Fig-ctxt" />). Each rule contains itself a list of field 
descriptions composed of a target value (TV), a matching operator (MO) and a Compression/Decompression Function (CDF).
